# SentiMuse: Prompt Co-Creation with Soul
SentiMuse is a human-first, emotionally intelligent writing companion that helps you generate creative, emotionally aware prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

It doesn't just generate prompts, it co-creates them with you based on your mood, topic, and journaling reflections. Think of it as a therapeutic journaling buddy that speaks your emotional language.

## Description
AI-generated content often feels robotic, generic, and lacks emotional nuance, especially for people going through emotional distress, cultural marginalization, or neurodivergent thought patterns. SentiMuse solves this by acting as an emotionally aware prompt co-creator that helps users (especially writers, creators, students, and mental health practitioners) craft deeply human, emotionally resonant prompts for generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
Whether you're a writer, student, creator, or mental health practitioner, SentiMuse helps you feel seen, heard, and inspired.

## Objectives
- Help users generate emotionally aware, simple prompts for AI writing tools.
- Support emotional well-being through creative self-expression.
- Bridge affective computing with real-world journaling and writing needs.
- Make prompt engineering more inclusive for neurodivergent or emotionally sensitive users.
